# Predicting-restaurant-tips-using-predictive-analytics-on-Excel.

Model to predict restaurant tips given input values with the mathematical equation for predicting the tip value.

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel, Data Analysis Add-in.

The following project tasks are performed in Excel:
1. The restaurant tips file for the analytics using Excel.
2. The data is preprocessed for further analysis using different data-cleaning techniques.
3. The independent and dependent features are identified.
4. The encoding of categorical variables to numeric values is done using IF conditions
5. An appropriate model is built using Multiple Linear Regression which is part of the Data Analysis Add-in.
6. The predicted and actual tip values are calculated using the intercept and slope values.
7. Also Calculated the RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) of the model.
